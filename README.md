# OpenGLengine
My simple OpenGL graphics engine for Windows. This is a work in progress.

## Description
The beginnings of an OpenGL game engine that I am building. Hierarchical models, the camera, and user input have been implemented. Future work I would like to add include sound, particle effects, and advanced shader effects (shadows, ambient occlusion, water flow, etc).

## Dependencies
This project uses OpenGL 4.0, as well as the SOIL image library, freeglut, and glew.

## Release
There is a pre-release version in the Release section that targets the Windows platform.

## Controls
W,A,S,D - camera movement
R, F - camera up/ down
Arrow Keys - camera pitch, yaw
Q, E - camera roll
